# TurboMemory X

## Description
TurboMemory X is an innovative project designed to integrate FPGA and SSD technology to achieve and surpass the performance of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) chips. This project aims to provide a cost-effective solution to memory shortages in the AI era by leveraging high-speed FPGA and DDR arrays.

## Features
- High-performance memory management
- Cost-effective alternative to HBM
- Scalability and flexibility in design
- Real-time data processing and storage

## Technologies Used
- FPGA: Xilinx UltraScale+
- SSD: Samsung 970 EVO
- Programming Languages: Verilog, VHDL, Python
- Tools: Vivado, ModelSim, Xilinx SDK

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- FPGA development board
- Vivado Design Suite
- ModelSim simulator
- Python 3.6+

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/drxucong/TurboMemoryX.git
    ```
2. Install the required tools and libraries.
3. Follow the configuration guide in the `docs/Configuration.md`.

## Usage
### Example
```python
# Example code to demonstrate the usage of TurboMemory X
import turbomemory

# Initialize the system
system = turbomemory.System()

# Configure FPGA and SSD
system.configure_fpga()
system.configure_ssd()

# Start processing
system.start_processing()
